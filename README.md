🌱
This is my personal repository where I put scripts and projects I am working on. 
I usually only program in Python and bash, but I also deal with some C++, Arduino/wiring, and tcl. I fear Javascript.


Topics I'm looking to study futher (as applied in cheminformatics):
- Data structrues 
- Graph Theory 
- Optimization algorithims
- Sympy library

📫 I'm not looking to collaborate yet, lots to work on for myself.
