ðŸŒ± Hello I'm Glogia (G-lo-gi-a). I'm a Graduate in Chemistry and this is my
personal repository where I put some of my projects that are a litte nicer 
(though often in progress) and some personal things like my vimrc or other 
things that are handy to have in a cloud.

I'm currently only really working in python, which is plenty really XD but
I've dabbled in some arduino code, Bash, and markdown languages.

Topics I'm looking to study futher:
- Data structrues 
- Graph Theory 
- Optimization algorithims (classic, genetic, other)
- Sympy library
- Web applications and servers for private use.

ðŸ“« I'm not looking to collaborate yet, lots to work on for myself.
